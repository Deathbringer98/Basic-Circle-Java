# Java Circle Program

This program demonstrates how to create a Circle class in Java. The Circle class has two instance variables: radius (of type double) and color (of type java.awt.Color).

The Circle class includes methods to calculate and return the area, perimeter, and a string representation of the circle.

The Demo.java file includes a main method that creates a Circle object with a radius of 5.0 and a color of red. The main method then prints the circle's details, including its area and perimeter.

## Usage

1. Download the provided Java Circle Program files.
2. Open the Circle.java file in a Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.
3. Run the Circle.java file to see the output.

Alternatively, you can create a new Java class (e.g., Demo.java) that includes the main method and create a Circle object within the main method. Then, you can run the Demo.java file to see the output.

## Dependencies

- Java JDK 1.8 or later
- A Java IDE, such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA


## - This is a Java program that defines a Circle class. The class has attributes for the radius and color of a circle, and methods to set these attributes and display them. Here's the breakdown:
    - Attributes:
        - radius: A double type variable to store the radius of the circle.
        - color: A String type variable to store the color of the circle.
        - pi: A constant initialized with value 3.14, representing an approximation of π (pi).
    - Constructors:
        - A no-argument constructor that initializes a new Circle object.
        - A parameterized constructor that takes two arguments, radius (of type double) and color (of type String), to initialize a new Circle object with specific values.
    - Getter and Setter Methods:
        - setRadius(double radius): Sets the radius attribute of the Circle object.
        - getRadius(): Returns the current value of the radius attribute.
        - setColor(String color): Sets the color attribute of the Circle object.
        - getColor(): Returns current value of color attribute.
    - Display Method:
        - display(): Prints out both radius and color attributes using System.out.println.
-     - The image shows a dark-themed IDE displaying Java code for a class named "Circle".
    - The code includes comments explaining constructors in green text, making it educational or instructional in nature.
    - There are three private attributes: double 'radius', String 'color', and final double 'pi' with an assigned value of 3.14
    - Two constructors are defined: one without parameters and another accepting two parameters for initializing 'radius' and 'color'.
    - Getter and setter methods are present for both 'radius' and 'color'.
    - There’s also a ‘display’ method that prints out values of ‘radius’ and ‘color’ when called.
