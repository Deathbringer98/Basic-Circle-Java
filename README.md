# Java Circle Program

This program demonstrates how to create a Circle class in Java. The Circle class has two instance variables: radius (of type double) and color (of type java.awt.Color).

The Circle class includes methods to calculate and return the area, perimeter, and a string representation of the circle.

The Demo.java file includes a main method that creates a Circle object with a radius of 5.0 and a color of red. The main method then prints the circle's details, including its area and perimeter.

## Usage

1. Download the provided Java Circle Program files.
2. Open the Circle.java file in a Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.
3. Run the Circle.java file to see the output.

Alternatively, you can create a new Java class (e.g., Demo.java) that includes the main method and create a Circle object within the main method. Then, you can run the Demo.java file to see the output.

## Dependencies

- Java JDK 1.8 or later
- A Java IDE, such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA
